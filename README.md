# ⚽ FootScan

**FootScan** is an open-source desktop application designed for advanced **football match prediction** using robust statistical and probabilistic models.  
This tool aims to help analysts, researchers and football enthusiasts **understand trends**, **evaluate performance**, and **predict match outcomes** based on real match data.

## 🧠 Models & Approach

FootScan combines multiple modeling approaches to capture both **historical data patterns** and **dynamic match behavior**:

- **Bayesian Models** – estimate probabilistic outcomes with uncertainty quantification.  
- **Hawkes Processes** – model event dynamics like goal occurrences and game pressure.  
- **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)** – capture latent states (e.g., team form and momentum) that influence outcomes.

These approaches produce predictions that are statistically meaningful and interpretable for match analysis.
